# Lazy Cover Letter

Deployed to Heroku at https://lazy-cover-letter.herokuapp.com/ 

### What the app does
This app was created to help people on the job search who are mass applying to create cover letters more easily. You simply fill out information in a form style response, and a cover letter is rendered based on the information provided. The app gets its name from the fact that the position and company will be automatically replaced in the cover letter paragraphs which allows people to be more "lazy". While you are typing it will show you what the pdf will look like once it is downloaded. When you are happy with the cover letter you simply press download and save it to your computer. The information entered can also be saved in browser local storage so it will be easy to use this application again and again.
